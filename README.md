Homebrew formulae
---

This is a place to hold my custom Homebrew formulae that are either not going to
be accepted to mainline Homebrew (e.g. mutt-sidebar) or that I want to ensure
that I have on hand (nethack-nao-osx).  If a formula listed here is accepted to
Homebrew, I will of course remove it.  While you can expect formulae listed here
to conflict with their mainline versions, they will be name differently so that
one can simply call `% brew install <FORMULA>` without having to specify the tap.

### Use
```
% brew tap ffleming/formulae
% brew install nethack-nao-osx
```
